1. The code will output 201	1	23.
2. A structure is a new data type that is customized by the user. It contains variables, not necessarily of the same type, linked together. It is used to link together data about something, used for things like an account or it can be used to describe traits of a person, for example. Enumerations connect variable names to constants like 1, 2, 3, and so on, which is more useful for iteration. An enumeration would be used to create a data type that iterates through different things, like a calendar.
3. Passing an array directly is a pass by reference, which means if you change/modify the array in the function it will change the original array. Passing an array contained within a structure is a pass by value, which means if you modify the array in the function it will not change the original array.
