1. It will be an error. This is because the struct is inside the main when functions should be written outside the main and only called in.

2. While structs and enums both store variables, enums are for more constant variables and structs are for more flexible chaning amounts. Structs: e.g. bank balances, numbers, etc. Enums: Calendars, 7 dwarfs,etc.

3. Passing an array directly to a function is passing the array by reference (which is local to the function) while passing a structure containing an array is passing by value (to modify the original memory location)
