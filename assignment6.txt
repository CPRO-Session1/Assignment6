1. This program will likely not even compile.The structure definion declares a type, not a variable that can be initialized. The values given for the ID, sex, and age in the employee structure definition are not recognized by the compiler because the compiler is only notified of their respective variables' presence. Therefore, no memory is allocated to the structure, so it cannot hold any values before being called.
2. Structures allow the programmer to group variables of mixed data types together into a single unit, whereas all variables in enumerations are integers. Although both hold multiple variables, enumerations provide only constants, but the elements of structures can be changed. Enumerations are helpful when the programmer has multiple units of information but doesn't want to remember these units by numbers. Structures are hlpful when the programmer has an entity that can be split up into numerous properties.
3. Passing an array directly to a function will pass the array by reference, meaning that after the function is completed, the elements of the array will still be modified. Passing a structure contaiing an array will pass the array by value, so the elements of the array are resetn every time the function runs.
