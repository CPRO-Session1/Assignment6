1) It won't compile, as it throws an error if you assign a value to a field in a struct. Also, it calls printf without importing stdio, and clrscr and getch without importing conio.h, which is exclusive to windows. 

2) One would use a structure when they need to store data that requires lots of variables, whereas one would use enums to make a list of things of a fixed size, where the important value isn't the value of the variable, but its name.

3) Arrays are usually passed by reference to functions, because they are really just pointers in disguise. Structs are passed by value, so wrapping an array in a struct would allow it to be passed by value rather than reference.
